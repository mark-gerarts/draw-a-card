# Draw a card

Draw a card selects a random exercise from [Draw a box](https://drawabox.com/)
which you can then use as a warmup exercise. It's loosely based on the
[Leitner flashcard system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system),
meaning exercises you get more proficient in get selected less often.

Start a local development server using Parcel:

```
$ npm run start
```

For some reason this defaults to the about page, I'm still figuring that out.

The `docs` folder gets published to Github pages, so after doing changes make
sure to run the following, and add the output to Git:

```
$ npm run-script build
```
